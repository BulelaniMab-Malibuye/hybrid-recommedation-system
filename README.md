# hybrid-recommedation-system
The hybrid recommendation system implemented in the code combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide movie recommendations.

Collaborative filtering is a technique that analyzes user behavior, such as ratings or interactions, to identify patterns and recommend items to users based on similarities between users or items. In the code, collaborative filtering is used to predict ratings given a movie ID and find users with similar high ratings for a given list of movies. The SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model is used for collaborative filtering in this implementation.

Content-based filtering, on the other hand, focuses on the attributes or characteristics of items to make recommendations. In the code, content-based filtering is used to recommend movies based on movie metadata, specifically the movie descriptions. The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer and cosine similarity are used to calculate similarity scores between movies based on their descriptions.

The hybrid recommendation system combines the recommendations generated by collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. In the collab_model function, collaborative recommendations and content-based recommendations are obtained separately. Then, the recommendations are combined, and duplicate movies are removed to ensure a diverse set of recommendations. Finally, the top-n recommendations are selected and returned to the user.

The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering captures user preferences and identifies similar users, while content-based filtering takes into account the content characteristics of items. By combining these approaches, the hybrid recommendation system aims to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations to users, potentially addressing the limitations of each individual technique.
